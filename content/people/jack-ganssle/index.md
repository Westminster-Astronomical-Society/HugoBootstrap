Jack is a retired electronics engineer who specialized in embedded systems. His primary interests in astronomy are astrophotography, deep dives into the science, and radio astronomy. He and his lovely wife Marybeth recently became grandparents, rather baffling as he’s pretty sure he’s still in high school.
