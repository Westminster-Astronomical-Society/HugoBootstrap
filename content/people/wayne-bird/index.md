Wayne "Skip" Bird is a NASA Heliophysics Ambassador, and presently the Outreach Director/Night Sky Network Guru for the Westminster Astronomical Society, an outreach fana (definition of fana: someone who will not change his mind AND will not change the subject).
He is also a “MAD” Science teacher for TGIF a home school group. He is the world-renowned author of "Night Flying Astronomy Bird" articles (OK, maybe world-renowned is being a little modest), and the World's Greatest Dad--he has the button to prove it, but enough about me.
