Curt was hooked on space as a pre-schooler watching live liftoffs of project Mercury astronauts on black and white TV. He joined his first astronomy club at age 14 with a 60mm refractor originally from Santa Claus. After graduating college, he left Nebraska and headed east to Maryland. Curt assembled a 12.5‚Äù Equatorial Newtonian telescope and, looking for darker skies, relocated to the Westminster area where, in 1984, he became of the first five members to organize and join the Westminster Astronomical Society, of Maryland. Since then he has enjoyed making friends with a host of marvelous people who share an interest in astronomy.

Curt is thankful for the efforts of our outstanding club members under whose supervision two wonderful facilities were established and maintained at Bear Branch Nature Center--the planetarium and the Blaine F. Roelke Memorial Observatory. The continuously expanding membership of the club is a constant source of pride for Curt.
