Interest in astronomy began at a very early age when I started helping my grandfather in Bombay, India, where he would grind his own mirrors and build his own Newtonian telescopes. The largest was an 8" Dob. He also was able to build a home projecting planetarium by drilling holes through a black hard plastic ball, inserting a light bulb, and fascinated the children in the neighborhood with doing shows in his large living room.
Many years later, I took up the hobby, mainly doing visual astronomy, then progressed to purchasing a 6" Celestron Go-To scope. Now use the ZWO Seestar 50 Smart Telescope that has opened up a whole new world, usually reserved for astrophotographers!
Served as Director of the Planetarium and is a Board Member of WASI, help contact astronomers around the country and the world to address our Club members for the monthly meetings.
Currently busy in private medical practice full time, teaching Residents in Internal Medicine, helping and guiding young pre-med college students, attempting to play golf (doing it badly!). For the past several months enjoying being a grandparent!
