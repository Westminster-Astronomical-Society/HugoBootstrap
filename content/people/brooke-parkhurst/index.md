Brooke received a degree in Botany from University of Maryland, College Park, but left academia to be a professional musician. After traveling the US playing Irish music she settled down as a pastry chef in several fine dining restaurants in Rappahannock County,
VA, as well as owning a successful gluten free bakery. Having now moved back to Maryland, she has had the luxury of pursuing her interest in astronomy.
