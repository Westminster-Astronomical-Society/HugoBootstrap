Here you will find a collection of references, both online and in print, that
cover a wide range of astronomy topics. These resources are suitable for
beginners as well as more experienced amateur astronomers looking to expand
their general understanding of the science of astronomy.

## General Astronomy Textbooks

These books provide a comprehensive overview of astronomy in non-technical
language. They cover a wide range of topics including the solar system, stars,
galaxies, and basic cosmology.

[**Astronomy 2e | OpenStax**](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/)  
Fraknoi, A., Morrison, D., & Wolff, S. (2022)  

Astronomy 2e is part of the OpenStax Open Educational Resources project at Rice
University. It is a free and open comprehensive introductory astronomy textbook.
It includes links to additional student and teacher resources at the OpenStax
website and elsewhere on web. This is really the only one you need.

[**Astronomy For Mere Mortals**](https://www.astroleague.org/navigating-the-night-sky-guides/)  
Clevenson, Aaron (2024)  

Astronomy for Mere Mortals is a free introductory astronomy textbook suitable
for non-science majors and the general public. The text in pdf format and additional
observing tools are available at the Astronomical League website.

## Observational Astronomy

These are not free (and like most textbooks they are not reasonably
priced). They are very useful for the more advanced amateur astronomer and are
certainly worth your while if you can find them in the library or a reasonably
priced used copy.

[**To Measure the Sky: An Introduction to Observational Astronomy**](https://www.google.com/books/edition/To_Measure_the_Sky/OB29T2BWLD4C?hl=en)  
Chromey, F. R. (2010). Cambridge University Press.

This is an undergraduate text on the fundamentals of observational astronomy. It
covers the basic principles of telescope optics, imaging sensors, coordinate
systems and data analysis.  

[**Observational Astronomy**](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Observational_Astronomy/cc9L8QWcZWsC?hl=en)  
Birney, D. S., Gonzalez, G., Oesper, D. (2006). Cambridge University Press.

This is a through introduction to observational and positional astronomy. It
covers time systems, charts and catalogs and modern astronomical databases. The
book includes Chapters on optical telescopes, detectors, photometry, variable
stars, astrometry.  

[**The Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac**](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/0YlpEQAAQBAJ?hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjSvMyNhu2PAxX4GVkFHTTFGC4Qre8FegQIDBAK)  
S.E. Urban and P.K. Seidelmann (Eds.) (2013). University Science Books.

The book is a detailed reference text to the algorithms and theories used to
produce The Astronomical Almanac. It covers the history, significance, sources,
methods of computation, and use of the data presented in The Astronomical
Almanac.

## Star Atlases

There are a number of excellent star atlases available to the Amateur
astronomer. The Cambridge Star Atlas and Sky & Telescope's Pocket Sky Atlas are
two very popular examples.

[Sky & Telescope’s Pocket Sky Atlas](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Sky_Telescope_s_Pocket_Sky_Atlas/QTnVsgEACAAJ?hl=en)

Uranometria 2000.0 is a comprehensive deep-sky atlas that serves as an essential
tool for amateur astronomers. It contains stars down to magnitude 9.75 and
30,000 deep-sky objects Uranometria 2000.0 is often considered the gold standard
for deep-sky atlases. There is a Deep Sky Field Guide that serves as an index to
the atlas containing observational data for all 30,000 objects.

## Printable Charts

Skymaps.com has printable planispheres for each month of the year. It includes a
list of interesting astronomical events and celestial objects visible in the
night sky.

## Observing Guides

**Burnham's Celestial Handbook**

Robert Burnham's classic three-volume Celestial Handbook is the amateur
astronomer's indispensable guide to the night sky. It contains detailed
descriptions of thousands of variable and double stars, star clusters, nebulae,
galaxies, and many other deep-sky objects. You really should pick up a set if
you get the chance.
